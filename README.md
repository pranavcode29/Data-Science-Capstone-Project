# Capstone Project - Data Science with Python Career Program
In this Project we have given the CARDETAILS dataset which is taken from kaggle. The data of this dataset is collected from 'Car Dekho'. This dataset contains details about different cars. This data has 4340 rows and 8 features . Following details of cars are included in the dataset:

1. Car name - Name of the car
2. Year - Year of the car when it was bought
3. Selling Price - Selling price of the car
4. Kms driven - Kilometers driven by the car
5. Fuel - Required fuel for the car
6. Seller type - Seller type of the car
7. Transmission - Transmission
8. Owner - Number of previous owners of the vehicle
   
# Link for the Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/car-details-dataset
In this Project we have to perform these actions - 
1. Explore the Data using Excel. understand the data and prepare a short summary about the dataset in the PPT.
2. Download the CARDETAILS dataset and perform Data cleaning and Data Pre-Processing if Necessary.
3. Use the various methods such as Handling null values, One-Hot Encoding, Imputation and Scaling of Data Pre-Processing where necessary.
4. Perform Exploratory data analysis(EDA) on the Data and perform Graphical Analysis on the Data. Include the graphs with conclusions from the Graphical Analysis.
5. Prepare the Data for Machine Learning modeling.
6. Apply various Machine Learning techniques such as Regressionorclassification, Bagging, Ensemble techniques and find out the best model using various Machine Learning model evaluation metrics.
7. Save the best model and Load the model.
8. Take the original dataset and make another dataset by randomly picking 20 data points from the CARDETAILS dataset and apply the saved model on the same Dataset and test the model.
9. Create an app.py file and other dependencies files for Streamlit app to be deployed on Streamlit Cloud. Make as simple website and deploy your ML model on Streamlit, Make the website public.
10. Share the Streamlit website and GitHub repository links in the Project PPT.

# Streamlit App
This project aims to provide a user-friendly web application that predicts the price of a car based on various features. The app is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web applications.
# Features
1. Predict the price of a car based on its features.
2. Explore the dataset and visualize the data.
3. Input various car features, such as brand, year, and more, to get an estimated price.
4. The app uses a trained machine learning model to make predictions.

So by using this library I made this app and you can access the app link here : https://data-science-capstone-project-r9gpc7869dq.streamlit.app/
